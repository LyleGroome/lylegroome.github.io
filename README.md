## Description
With N-Counter, you can create one or more counters and categorize them into counter sets. To get started, create a counter set for a specific purpose, then add counters to the set. You can customize the title and color of each button, and whether to include a decrement button. Counter settings and values are stored permanently in a database on your device until you either reset the counter or delete it. 
                    
You also have the option to configure a counter to record an event with each click that includes the time of the event or the time and geographic location. For counters with events, you can display a chronological list of events or a map of events locations.
                    
N-Counter is free to use for 14 days, after which you will be asked to purchase a one-time license.  Some features may be limited during the free trial.
